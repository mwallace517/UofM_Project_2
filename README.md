In this project, I conducted a mock penetration test on a fictional organization that hosted a vulnerable web application, as well as attempting to attack its' Linux and Windows servers. In order to get full credit, I had to find a total of 20 vulnerabilities between all 3 environments. At the end of the penetration test I put my findings into a penetration test report to send to my fictional organization to review and learn about our vulnerabilities, and explain ways to mitigate or get rid of them.
